## Install

### Stable

Download stable release [here](https://github.com/asunlabs/owlly/releases/tag/stable). This is the almost same version with the above GIF demonstration(toast notification added)

### Latest

Owlly is under active development. If you want to explore the latest feature and changes, follow below install guide.

Clone this repo. Make sure to install all dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asunlabs/owlly.git
```

Look over with development mode.

```sh
wails dev
```

Build it with Wails. This will conveniently compile the project based on your OS and architecture.

```sh
wails build
```

Execute binary.

```sh
owlly
```

## Prerequisite

### Assumption

Owlly will check if below files exist in your project root and sync if exist.

```go
	envList  = []string{
		".env",
		".env.test",
		".env.development",
		".env.production",
		".env.dev",
		".env.stage",
		".env.prod",
		".env.local",
		".env.development.local",
		".env.test.local",
		".env.production.local",
	}
```

Owlly ver 0.3.1 is event-based. When form value is submitted in react client side, the value is tossed to go backend by wails. Owlly takes the value and uses for its configuration under the hood.

### Slack

In order to use Owlly, you have to

1. Create a slack bot [here](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Install the bot to your slack workspace
3. Issue bot user oauth token and get channel ID to use the bot.

Make sure your bot has proper configuration/privileges to for sending DM. Refer below to set up a permission scope.

## Usage

1. Run Owlly

```sh
./owlly-for-windows.exe
./owlly-for-mac
./owlly-for-mac-m1
```

2. Update .env files as you wish.

```sh
FOO="bar"
```

3. Once done, set owlly trigger in your .env. This variable will be a key for Owlly to know if your update is done. So your .env will look like,

```sh
AUTHOR="developerasun"
FOO="bar"

# length of OWLLY_DONE > 0 ? send a DM : do nothing
# OWLLY_DONE="true" // add this line when update is done
```

4. Click send button. Check your slack channel if the message is sent. Result will look like below.

## Workflows

In Owlly, a several groups of automation is configured.

- auto pull request reviewer
- auto pull request label by branch name
- auto format and lint for go codes
- auto release by push
- auto dependency tracking
- auto staled issue checking

If you add some workflows to owlly, I would suggest to develop it with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to check the workflows locally first and then open a pull request.

Note that the act is based on Docker, meaning you have to run Docker daemon first.

```sh
# Run act dry-run
act -n push
act -n pull_request
```

## Contribution

Owlly is a open sourc project. Feel free to open a pull request and suggest changes / improvement.
